# Project 1: Understanding sentiments from comments on YouTube
Analzyed top video comments from across 5 different YouTube channels which uploaded Matt Reeve's The Batman (2021) movie trailer.
• Scraped over 5000 comments using python and selenium
• Interpreted sentiments from comments using VADER


Future work:
• Currently building a tailored library since VADER library is not specific for YouTube comments
• Use multiclassification algorithm
